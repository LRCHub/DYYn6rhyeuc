# Jungle – GOOD TIMES

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Morning dew
Vaporised
Rays of sun
Blinding my eyes
'Cause I feel alive
Good times
You'll find
Good times
Down in the street
Lights out
Super power
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
Light up
The Eiffel Tower
It feels like
there ain't nothing to lose
Good times
You'll find
Good times
Down in the street
Lights out
Super power
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
Light up
The Eiffel Tower
Feels like
there ain't nothing to lose
Good times
You'll find
Good times
Down in the street
Lights out
Super power
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
Light up
The Eiffel Tower
Feels like
(Don't you leave me now)
(Ooh)
(Got me crying out)
(Down in the street)
Good times
You'll find
Good times
Down in the street
Good times
Good times (Ooh)
Good times
Good (Down in the street)
Good times
Good times (Ooh)
Good times
Good (Down in the street)
Good times
Good
Times, good-good
Times, good
